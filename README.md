HTML and CSS Navigation Project
In this project, I focused on creating a responsive and visually appealing navigation menu using HTML and CSS. The goal was to design a user-friendly navigation bar that works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

Key Features:
Responsive Design: The navigation menu adjusts gracefully to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Clean and Modern Layout: I employed a minimalist design approach with a clean layout that highlights simplicity and usability.
Hover Effects: I added subtle hover effects to the menu items, enhancing the user interaction without overwhelming the design.
Dropdown Menu: For more complex navigation structures, I implemented a dropdown menu using CSS, ensuring that it is easy to navigate and visually integrated with the rest of the design.
Sticky Navigation: The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the page as users scroll down, providing easy access to all sections of the site at all times.
Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring the content and creating the navigation elements.
CSS3: For styling the navigation bar, adding responsiveness, and creating interactive elements such as hover effects and dropdowns.
Learning Outcomes:
Gained a deeper understanding of responsive design principles and how to implement them effectively.
Improved my skills in creating interactive and user-friendly navigation menus.
Learned how to handle different states of navigation elements, such as active states and hover effects, to improve user experience.
